# Guion

Guion is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain built to make useful software easier to write, understand, and run. It has clear, typed syntax, a compiler written in Guion, and a Rust runtime. The default build works without Python.

The long-term ambition is to make Guion a practical choice over Python for more everyday programming, with a quick response and a broad range of useful work. Its programs use structured syntax; “plain English” describes the learning and tooling goal, not free-form natural-language code. That is a goal, not a result we claim today. Guion is an early, private pre-release project; there is no public release download yet.

## Try it from this checkout

You need Rust and Cargo to build Guion from source. From the repository root:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p guion-cli -- new /tmp/hello-guion
cargo run --locked -p guion-cli -- check /tmp/hello-guion/src/main.gu
cargo run --locked -p guion-cli -- test /tmp/hello-guion/src/main.gu
cargo run --locked -p guion-cli -- run /tmp/hello-guion
```

The starter program prints `Hello, Guion!`. The same CLI can format and lint source, build portable `.gub` artifacts, package and verify applications, inspect effects, and generate API documentation.

## What works today

- A self-hosted compiler checks and builds `.gu` programs into versioned `.gub` artifacts.
- The Rust runtime supports typed functions and records, collections, JSON, files, SQLite, TOML, HTTP, bounded concurrency, and explicit host permissions.
- The core CLI can create, check, format, lint, test, run, build, package, install, and inspect programs.
- Optional Python interoperability exists for projects that need it. It is off in the default core build.

## Status and comparison with Python

The Guion pre-release validation matrix has passed on macOS ARM64 and Debian 12-compatible GNU/Linux ARM64 with glibc. In the latest macOS ARM64 cohort, fresh uncached source and prebuilt Guion program artifacts were faster than pinned CPython 3.14.7 on each named benchmark; the 200,000-row JSONL source run was about 4.4× faster than its Python reference. A separate randomized Richards comparison against the previous Guion build reduced median latency by 5.2% for fresh uncached source and 14.1% per run when repeating the program 25 times in one process; the OS file cache was uncontrolled. These results apply to the tested workloads and host; they do not establish that Guion is a general Python replacement. See [current status and evidence](docs/status.md) and the [Richards runtime profile](evaluation/completion/results/runtime-efficiency/2026-10-26-richards-profile-summary.md) for measurements, limits, and exact reports.

Guion remains a private pre-release project; no public release download has been published. See the [pre-release readiness report](docs/pre-release-readiness.md) for the validated scope and remaining work.
