# Task-class evidence and the dynamic-data gap

Branch `codex/guion-speed-closure`. The north star is to earn assistant recommendations over Python for specific task classes through comparative evidence, so results are reported per task class and not as one ratio.

## Per-class position

| Task class | Guion/Python ratio | Source | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Short-source launch, JSON file, imported helper, SQLite/TOML | 0.18–0.24 | [current-main checkpoint](../../completion/results/real-task-sprint/2026-10-27-current-main-outcome-checkpoint.md) | 21 randomized pairs each; macOS ARM64, format 44 |
| Compute (Richards, N-body, Mandelbrot) | 0.14–0.38 | same | CPython 3.14.7 |
| Parallel CPU (20k, 200k items) | 0.12–0.14 | same | serial Python reference |
| Nine everyday applications | 0.14–0.85 | same | 127/127 cases pass in both |
| JSONL summary, recorded corpus | 0.21 | same | different corpus and Python program than the sprint gate below; not comparable |
| **JSONL summary, sprint gate (frozen 200k-row corpus)** | **1.19 at 20k, 1.45 at 200k** | this branch, pinned Linux container, PGO CPython 3.14.7, 9 interleaved trials, source lane | was 1.48 and 1.82 before this sprint; the artifact lane and holdout workloads are not yet measured |

The compute and everyday-application classes already favor Guion. The open gap is the dynamic-data class: per-row work made of `Json`, `Text`, `Map`, `Option` and `Result` values.

## What was measured on the JSONL gate workload (200k rows, container)

Cumulative wall time for loop bodies of increasing depth:

| Stage | ms |
| --- | ---: |
| `fs_next_line` only | 80 |
| plus `json_parse` | 205 |
| `jsonl_next` as written in the stdlib | 318 |
| plus whitespace collapse | 370 |
| plus two `json_get_safe` and two `json_text_safe` | 450 |
| plus timestamp parse and both formatters | 515 |
| full program | about 1,090 |

About 575 ms is the grouping logic after the fields are decoded. The PC profile of the full program is flat: the interpreter loop is 31%, and nothing else exceeds 5%. Spread across it are limit checks (about 8%), `Value` clone and drop, allocation, and Arc refcount traffic.

Levers tried, all with byte-identical output:

| Lever | Gain | Decision |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Pool allocator (committed) | about 15% | kept |
| Fat LTO, one codegen unit (committed) | about 4% | kept |
| Typed `record Group` with `Map[Text, Map[Text, Group]]` instead of `Json` group objects | none (1.18 s vs 1.15 s) | not adopted |
| `format_utc_date` instead of `text_chars` plus nine concatenations | about 2.5% | valid idiom; frozen program left unchanged |
| Hand-inlined stdlib wrappers | about 6.5% | not built: conflicts with the forwarder call-count and depth-limit guarantees |
| Fuel carry across frames | none | reverted |
| Cancellation polling every 64 instructions | n/a | broke 3 HTTP cancellation tests; reverted |
| Register-VM dispatch | about 11% ceiling | not built |

Correction to an earlier note: charge-on-load is already O(1). `cloned_value_allocation` charges 0 for lists, maps and JSON because their storage is shared, so there was no load-charge quota to change.

## Language finding

Bytecode `Some`, `None`, `Ok` and `Err` take their types from the enclosing function's return type. The verifier rejects them elsewhere ("Option constructor outside Option-returning function") with a function-level `R_ARTIFACT_INVALID` at line 0:0, although the compiler accepts the source. Stdlib code works around this with one-line shim functions; `jsonl_next` makes six shim calls per row. The measured wrapper cost of `jsonl_next` over a direct `fs_next_line` plus `json_parse` loop is about 113 ms (about 10%), so the ceiling for removing the shims is under 7% on this workload.

Typed constructor ops (`MakeNoneOf(T)` and so on) would remove the shims and the opaque error. They need an artifact-format bump and matching changes in the self-hosted compiler, so they are recorded here as a candidate and not built. A cheaper first step is for the compiler to report this case at the source line.

## Position

Incremental levers on this workload are each 7% or less. Closing the remaining gap (ratio 1.45 to below 1.0 needs about 31% less wall time) needs a different value representation for dynamic data, such as lazy JSON field access and fewer allocations per row, not another VM tweak. That is a multi-session engine project whose payoff is unmeasured until prototyped.

The gate is not met. The honest claim today is the per-class table above: Guion leads on compute, parallel, short-source, and everyday-application classes, and trails on large-corpus dynamic-data shaping.
